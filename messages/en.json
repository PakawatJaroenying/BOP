		"companyHistory": "Blue Ocean Plastic Recycling is transforming waste into opportunity. We work hand-in-hand with informal and formal waste collectors, ensuring fair, transparent, and traceable recycling practices. From first- and second-mile waste pickers to community waste banks, we help create ethical supply chains that meet global standards. As Asia, especially in Thailand and SEA, transitions to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes and Europe enforces stricter grievance mechanisms for recycled plastics, we help businesses and communities adapt. We don‚Äôt just verify recycled plastic‚Äîwe empower responsible sourcing, collaborating with partners like Tide Ocean to support brands committed to sustainability. Starting as a nonprofit, we have grown into an impact-driven enterprise, strengthening partnerships through grants, research, and innovation. In the UNDP-funded ABIC Program, we work with the tourism sector to design waste management models that benefit corporations, brands, and local communities. Our collaboration with Second Muse explores eco-bricks as a low- value waste solution for Thai Gulf islands, connecting community waste banks to circular economy models. By working together, we create real change. From Waste to Worth‚ÄîDriven by Human Values.‚ôªüåç",
