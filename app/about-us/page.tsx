						Our Mission to Combat Plastic Waste
					</h2>
					<p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">
						Since July 2022, Blue Ocean Plastic Recycling (BOP) in cooperation
						with Ranong Recycle Enterprise (RRE) and WWF Thailand has worked
						with around 20 communities along the Koh Samui‚Äôs coast lines.
						Overall, nearly 2,000 local people have joined in the community-led
						waste bank network resulting in the recovery of 200 tons of plastics
						which comprises both high-value and low-value plastic. The
						high-value goes to the manufacturers for reprocessing; the
						low-value, to the local recyclers of eco-bricks, souvenirs and many
						more. This highlights a successful model of waste management
						endeavors spearheaded by the communities on both ends of the value
						chain of recycled plastic‚Äîcollection and reprocessing. The plastic
						credit/incentivisation schemes introduced by RRE to the waste bank
						network not only yields economic and social benefits for the locals,
						but its systematic approach also helps improve the transparency and
						traceability in the supply chain. All of this‚Äîwhile empowering and
						up-skilling local communities and entities to become an essential
						part of the value chain. a cleaner, healthier marine environment for
						future generations.
